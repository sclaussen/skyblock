Amber (Goblin Holdout)
The Amber Crystal is obtained from the Goblin Queen's Den in the
Goblin Holdout.  In order to obtain it, the player must first get the
King's Scent Potion Effect, which is obtained from King Yolkar after
giving him 3 Goblin Eggs of the same color.  After obtaining the
King's Scent effect, the Queen's Den can be entered to obtain the
Crystal. This effect lasts for 20 minutes, but it can be used multiple
times to get the crystal. Entering water will remove the effect.

Sapphire Crystal (Precursor Remnants)
The Sapphire Crystal is obtained by giving the 6 different Automaton
Parts (obtained from loot chests in the Precursor Remnants or from
killing Iron Golem Sprite Automatons) to Professor Robot in the Lost
Precursor City. After giving the parts to him, he will repair the
Automaton Prime, and a door will open which reveals the crystal.

Amethyst (Jungle)
The Amethyst Crystal is obtained from entering the Jungle Temple by
giving a Kalhuiki Door Guardian a Jungle Key (Obtained by killing the
Jungle Key Guardian or purchased from Odawa) and completing the
parkour.

Topaz (Magma)
The Topaz Crystal is obtained after defeating Bal, located in
Khazad-dÃ»m in the Magma Fields.  After defeating the boss, the Crystal
will spawn nearby.
